## FedSeleKDistill

FedSeleKDistill, Federated Selection and Knowledge Distillation Algorithm, is FL training algorithm with the goal of decreasing the overall communication costs. FedSeleKDistill is an innovative combination of: (i) client selection, and (ii) knowledge distillation approaches with three main objectives: (i) reducing the number of devices training at every round; (ii) decreasing the number of rounds until convergence; and (iii) mitigating the effect of client’s heterogeneous data on the GM effectiveness.
